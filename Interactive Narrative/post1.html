            <h1>Hange ZoÃ«</h1>
            
            <p>
                
                Hange was the 14th commander of the Survey Corps. They fascinate me because they are an eccentric and brillaint scientist that has a lot of quirky qualities. Over the course of the story, Hange gradually becomes the commander of the Survey Corps, although this change in responsibily takes a toll on Hange's optimistic personality it is shown that Hange is a caring leader that tries thier best.
                During the first two seasons of "Attack on Titan" Hange is the comedic relief and an innovator, but after Erwin Smith(the previous commander) dies they start to lead the attack operations as the commander. Throughtout the story, all the members of the Survey Corps look up to Hange and mourn thier heroic death.
