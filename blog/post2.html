    <p>After reading the article, I learned a lot about semantic HTML and its uses. For example,
        an advantage of semantic HTML includes it being easier to read by web developers. Two of the other advanteges of semantic HTML include it being easier
        to read by visually imaired people(because thier screen readers find it easier to interpret content written in semantic HTML), another advantage is that semantic HTML is important to SEO because the tags indicate the roles which makes it easier for search engine crawlers to find your content.  
    </p>
    <p>Given the advantages of semantic HTML, I have used it in my previous blog post to differentiate between the headers and the paragraphs. In my blog post I am trying to have a green gradient background and I want my blog posts to have a similar color.</p>
