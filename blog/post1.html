        <p >In our group research, we focused on the media on the internet and how it has affected many sectors, mainly: news reporting, the music business, the movie/television business, and education. For example,multiple news outlets on the internet have created many sources (sometimes too many sources) of information. Music has been on the internet for a few decades at this point, and we talked a bit about popular music sites and thier histories, especially Limewire. We also talked about movie streaming sites, like Amazon Prime and Netflix, and how the internet affects education with websites like Khan academy and EdX.
        The internet affecting different sectors has been something I have seen my entire life. From watching movies online, listening to music online, learning online. I was able to easily connect these concepts to my own life. </p>
