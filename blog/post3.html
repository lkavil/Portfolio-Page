    <p> I would like to create a site on my favorite fictional characters. I would like to create an analysis on each and write about my thoughts on each character. Here are some similar websites that inspire me:</p>
    <p>CBR.com-is a website that is about animated tv shows, movies and comics. I check the site pretty often if I want to know more about a character.</p>
    <p><img src="images/Cbr.jpg" alt="CBR "></p>
    
    
    <p> Another site that I look to is fandom.com, I go to this site to learn more about characters and thier backgrounds</p>
