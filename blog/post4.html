    <p>While reading "Learning Web Design" I learned many interesting things about CSS and the various layout techniques. In Chp.14, the book talks about creating box shadows, and I have enjoyed playing around with box shadows in my designs, so I liked that section. In chapter 15, the book talks about floating, which is moving an element left or right in order to format the text around it. In some of my projects where I use both text and images, formatting the text around the images is difficult for me so floating and float containment would be useful layout techniques for me to use.
        Chapter 16, about flexboxes and grids, has been very useful for me since we have been using them a lot in class assignments. In chapter 17, responsive web design, was used in my blog website. Media query was the most interesting to me because I would want to learn how change the style of the page based on the screen size or the orientation.
